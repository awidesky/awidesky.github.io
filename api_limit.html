    <h1>API rate limit!<h1>
        <h2>Thanks for your huge interests on me, but it might seemed a lot to github :D<h2>
            <hr>
            
            <p>GitHub <a href="https://docs.github.com/ko/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api">restricts</a>  its REST api request limits to about 60 requests per hour. And it seems you exeeded that limit.
            <br>Please try again after a coffee or walk, then it'll work again.</p>
            <p>Or maybe, you can walk through my GitHub <a href='https://github.com/awidesky/'>profile</a> or <a href='https://github.com/awidesky?tab=repositories'>repositories</a> via github.com  directly!</p>
